`cf-graphql` is a library that allows you to query your data stored in [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). A schema and value resolvers are automatically generated out of an existing space.

Generated artifacts can be used with any node-based GraphQL server. The outcome of the project's main function call is an instance of the [`GraphQLSchema`](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) class.

## Disclaimers

Please note that `cf-graphql` library is released as an experiment:

- we might introduce breaking changes into programmatic interfaces and space querying approach before v1.0 is released
- thereâ€™s no magic bullet: complex GraphQL queries can result in a large number of CDA calls, which will be counted against your quota
- we might discontinue development of the library and stop maintaining it


## First steps

If you just want to see how it works, please follow the [Demo](#demo) section. You can deploy the demo with your own credentials so it queries your own data.

In general `cf-graphql` is a library and it can be used as a part of your project. If you want to get your hands dirty coding, follow the [Programmatic usage](#programmatic-usage) section.


## Demo

We host an [online demo](https://cf-graphql-demo.now.sh/) for you. You can query Contentful's "Blog" space template there. This how its graph looks like:

![Demo space graph](./demo/demo-space-graph.png)


### Run it locally

This repository contains a demo project. The demo comes with a web server (with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) enabled) providing the GraphQL endpoint but also [an in-browser IDE(GraphiQL)](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

To run it, clone the repository, install dependencies and start a server:

```
git clone git@github.com:contentful-labs/cf-graphql.git
cd cf-graphql/demo
nvm use # optional, but we prefer node v6.10
npm install
npm start
```

Use <http://localhost:4000/graphql/> to query the data from within your application or navigate to <http://localhost:4000> to use the IDE (GraphiQL) for test-querying. Please refer to the [Querying](#querying) section for more details.

To use your own Contentful space with the demo, you have to provide:

- space ID
- CDA token
- CMA token

Please refer the ["Authentication" section](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/) of Contentful's documentation.

You can provide listed values with env variables:

```
SPACE_ID=some-space-id CDA_TOKEN=its-cda-token CMA_TOKEN=your-cma-token npm start
```

#### Run a FrontEnd using GraphQL

If you also want to see how to integrate GraphQL e.g. in a React technology stack the demo project also contains an application based on the [Apollo framework](https://www.apollodata.com/).
To check it out, make sure the demo GraphQL server is running (`npm start`) and then start the development server for the React application:

```
npm run client
```

The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Deploy to [Zeit's `now`](https://zeit.co/now)

To be able to deploy to [Zeit's `now`](https://zeit.co/now) you need to have an activated account. There is a free open source option available.

You can also deploy the demo with `now`. In your terminal, navigate to the `demo/` directory and run:

```
npm run deploy-demo-now
```

As soon as the deployment is done you'll have a URL of your GraphQL server copied.

You can also create a deployment for your own space:

```
SPACE_ID=some-space-id CDA_TOKEN=its-cda-token CMA_TOKEN=your-cma-token npm run deploy-now
```

Please note:

- when deploying a server to consume Contentful's "Blog" space template, the command to use is `npm run deploy-demo-now`; when the demo should be configured to use your own space, the command is `npm run deploy-now`
- if you've never used `now` before, you'll be asked to provide your e-mail; just follow on-screen instructions
- if you use `now`'s OSS plan (the default one), the source code will be public; it's completely fine: all credentials are passed as env variables and are not available publicly


## Programmatic usage

The library can be installed with `npm`:

```
npm install --save cf-graphql
```

Let's assume we've required this module with `const cfGraphql = require('cf-graphql')`. To create a schema out of your space you need to call `cfGraphgl.createSchema(spaceGraph)`.

What is `spaceGraph`? It is a graph-like data structure containing descriptions of content types of your space which additionally provide some extra pieces of information allowing the library to create a GraphQL schema. To prepare this data structure you need to fetch raw content types data from the [CMA](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/) and then pass it to `cfGraphql.prepareSpaceGraph(rawCts)`:

```js
const client = cfGraphql.createClient({
  spaceId: 'some-space-id',
  cdaToken: 'its-cda-token',
  cmaToken: 'your-cma-token'
});

client.getContentTypes()
.then(cfGraphql.prepareSpaceGraph)
.then(spaceGraph => {
  // `spaceGraph` can be passed to `cfGraphql.createSchema`!
});
```

The last step is to use the schema with a server. A popular choice is [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql). The only caveat is how the context is constructed. The library expects the `entryLoader` key of the context to be set to an instance created with `client.createEntryLoader()`:

```js
// skipped: `require` calls, Express app setup, `client` creation

// `spaceGraph` was fetched and prepared in the previous snippet:
const schema = cfGraphql.createSchema(spaceGraph);
// BTW, you shouldn't be doing it per request, once is fine

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP(() => ({
  schema,
  context: {entryLoader: client.createEntryLoader()}
})));
```

[You can see a fully-fledged example in the `demo/` directory](./demo/server.js).


## Querying

For each content type there are two root-level fields:

- a singular field accepts a required `id` argument and resolves to a single entity
- a collection field accepts an optional `q` argument and resolves to a list of entities; the `q` argument is a query string you could use with the [CDA](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/)

Assuming you've got two content types named `post` and `author` with listed fields, this query is valid:

```graphql
{
  authors {
    name
  }

  posts(q: "fields.rating[gt]=5") {
    title
    rating
  }

  post(id: "some-post-id") {
    title
    author
    comments
  }
}
```

Reference fields will be resolved to:

- a specific type, if there is a validation that allows only entries of some specific content type to be linked
- the `EntryType`, if there is no such constraint. The `EntryType` is an interface implemented by all the specific types

Example where the `author` field links only entries of one content type and the `related` field links entries of multiple content types:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    author {
      name
      website
    }

    related {
      ... on Tag {
        tagName
      }
      ... on Place {
        location
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Backreferences (_backrefs_) are automatically created for links. Assume our `post` content type links to the `author` content type via a field named `author`. Getting an author of a post is easy, getting a list of posts by an author is not. `_backrefs` mitigate this problem:

```graphql
{
  authors {
    _backrefs {
      posts__via__author {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When using backreferences, there is a couple of things to keep in mind:

- backrefs may be slow; always test with a dataset which is comparable with what you've got in production
- backrefs are generated only when a reference field specifies a single allowed link content type
- `_backrefs` is prefixed with a single underscore
- `__via__` is surrounded with two underscores; you can read this query out loud like this: _"get posts that link to author via the author field"_
